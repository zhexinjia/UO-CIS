# Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests select "Test" from the "Product" menu in Xcode.  This will compile and run the unit tests.  Note that if you have not finished your implementation or there are inconsistencies between the symbol names the unit tests are written with and what you have implemented, the tests will not compile and you will receive errors.  The errors should clearly indicate what symbols are missing to help you track down where the inconsistency is.  If your implementation is finished and correct, all 38 unit tests should pass.

# Example Output

Here is some example output from the solution implementation for your reference.  Your output should be identical to this output, with the exception of the elements that are influenced by random variation (even times and whether or not a participant succeeds or fails).
