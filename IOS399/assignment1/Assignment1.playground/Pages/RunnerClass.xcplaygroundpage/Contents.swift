# Runner class

The `Runner` class is a subcass of the `Athlete` class that provides a more specific implementation of the `favoriteSport` computed property.  Open the Runner.swift file that already exists in this project and implement the `Runner` class as described below.

1. The class will override the implementation of the parent `favoriteSport` property by using a computed property that only specifies a get block which returns `Sport.Runner`.

The next page will describe how to [implement the TriathlonEvent class](@next).
