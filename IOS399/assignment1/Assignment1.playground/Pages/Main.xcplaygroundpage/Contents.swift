# Main swift file

The main.swift file is the entry point into a Swift command line program.  Code can be written directly in the file, similar to a playground.  Open the main.swift file that already exists in this project and implement the code as described below.

1. To run the triathlon simulation, first create an instance of the `TriathlonEvent` class.

2. Once the `TriathlonEvent` instance has been created, create and register participants with the following types and names:

	* A `Swimmer` named "Cassi"
	* A `Swimmer` named "Jason"
	* A `Swimmer` named "Kathy"
	* A `Cyclist` named "Asia"
	* A `Cyclist` named "David"
	* A `Runner` named "Sigh"
	* A `Runner` named "Becky"
	* An `Athlete` named "Charles"
	* An `Athlete` named "Chuck"

3. After all the participants have been registered, perform the event.

4. Once the event has been performed, if there is a winner print the text "<winner name> wins first place with a total time of <total time> minutes!".  If there is no winner print the text "No one finished the race!".

The next page will describe how to [run Unit Tests and list example output](@next).
