# Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to create a simple triathlon simulation command line program using many of the features of the Swift programming language to help prepare you for writing iOS apps.  The pages of this playground will walk you through the implementation, with each page having you create a piece of the code that will be part of the simulation.  You may want to utilize the Assistant Editor feature of Xcode to view the playground and your code at the same time.  You can find the Assistant Editor in the "View" menu, under "Assistant Editor"; selecting "Show Assistant Editor", then "All Editors Stacked Vertically", and setting the lower editor to show the playground in Manual mode via its navigation bar is one convenient way to utilize it.

The project contains some pre-written unit tests which will test the code you write.  Because Swift is a case sensitive language (as most are), you must take extra caution in making sure your names match the specification in the playground precisely; if they do not, the tests will not compile properly.  Once your implementation is finished you will be able to choose the "Test" option from the "Product" menu in order to run the tests and make sure that your implementation is correct.  If any tests fail, examine the failure messages for an indication of where the bug in your code is.

The next page will describe the first implementation task: [Implementing the Sport enum](@next).
