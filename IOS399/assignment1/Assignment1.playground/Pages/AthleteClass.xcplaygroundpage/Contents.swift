# Athlete class

The `Athlete` class is a concrete class that conforms to the `Participant` protocol.  Open the Athlete.swift file that already exists in this project and implement the `Athlete` class as described below.

1. The class will implement the `name` property requirement of the `Participant` protocol by using a constant with no initial value defined.
2. The class will implement the `favoriteSport` property requirement of the `Participant` protocol by using a computed property that only specifies a get block which returns nil.
3. The class will implement the initializer declared in the `Participant` protocol and set the initial value of the `name` property to the value passed as a parameter.

The next page will describe how to [implement the Swimmer class](@next).
